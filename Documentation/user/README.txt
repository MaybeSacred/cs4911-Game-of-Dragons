Game Concepts:
---------------
You are a dragon who has become trapped in the walls of the Ice Castle. The
outer gate to this castle is locked shut, and the only way to open it is
through the power of the magic gems that are scattered throughout the world.
In the castle, there are hostile beings which drop fragments of these gems
upon being slain, and collecting four of these fragments creates a full gem. 
After collecting at least ten full gems, you must find and strike the crystal
ball to power it and open the castle's outer gate. Beyond the gate is a
portal away from the Ice Castle and to freedom.

You may replenish lost health by collecting coins, gem fragments, and gems.
Throughout the world are checkpoints that are represented by floating C's.
Touching a checkpoint will save your progress so that you will return to the
checkpoint if you run out of health.
