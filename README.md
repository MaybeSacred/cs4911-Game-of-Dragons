Some Lessons Learned
Pay attention to how many triangles your mesh has. The higher, the slower your game will run.
If youâ€™re doing 3d modeling in Maya, Make sure you are displaying your polygon count: Display > Heads Up Display > Poly Count. You can reduce the number of triangles in your mesh  a) after doing a mesh clean up (Mesh > Cleanup) b) then Using Mesh > Reduce
